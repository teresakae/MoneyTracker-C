# Money Tracker (SFT 118 - Algorithms and Programming Final Project)
A simple income-expense tracker with date, name, and category sorting, featuring visualized summary graphs. Built using C and SQL within the NetBeans IDE.
This repository contains a simple income and expense tracking application, developed as the final project for SFT 118 - Algorithms and Programming. This was a beginner group project.

## Features
* **Data Entry:** Easily record income and expenses with details such as date, name/description, and category. Data is persistently stored in an SQL database.
* **User-Friendly Interface:** A straightforward interface for easy data input, modification, and viewing.
* **Categorization:** Organize transactions into user-defined categories for effective financial analysis.
* **Graphical Summary:** Visualize income and expense trends with clear and informative graphs.
* **Persistent Data Storage:** Data is stored and managed within an SQL database, ensuring data persistence across sessions.

## Purpose
This project demonstrates the application of fundamental programming concepts learned in SFT 118 - Algorithms and Programming, including:
* Data structures (e.g., arrays, structs)
* Database interaction (SQL)
* Data visualization (using C libraries)
* Basic file handling (CRUD operations)

## Technologies Used
* **Programming Language:** C
* **IDE:** NetBeans
* **Database:** MySQL (via XAMPP)
